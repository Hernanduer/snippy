# snippy
An IRC Bot for screeps

# Installation
Snippy is not meant to be replicated en masse as of yet.  It can be run using `npm start`, though you must supply environment variables for it to function properly

The required variables are as listed below:
```
IRC_NETWORK
IRC_NICK
IRC_NAME
IRC_PASSWORD
IRC_ROOMS
IRC_TRUSTED

TWITTER_ENABLED (boolean)
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

SCREEPS_ENABLED (boolean)
SCREEPS_USERNAME
SCREEPS_PASSWORD
```

# Roadmap

I might want to make this act as more of a barebones bot with optional plugins, but that's farther down the road.  If anyone wants to work on something like that, feel free to.

# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the project.  Follow standard code of conduct when communicating with others on the project
